       <p1><i><strong>spreading love, not the virus</strong></i></p1>
    <p>Our goal is to gather used but functioning tech, such as old iPhones, to donate to those most affected by the coronavirus. We have partnered with hospitals and assisted care facilities across the Greater Boston area and the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program to connect people to their loved ones and support those who are in need of telemedicine visits.</p>

    <h1>why</h1>
    <p>When a patient is hospitalized in isolation, they often do not have any personal belongings such as their smartphone or tablet with them. Additionally, people in nursing homes and assisted living facilities generally do not have a FaceTime-enabled device with them, even though they will be in extreme isolation for the longest amount of time. Many patients currently homeless also experience some of the worst effects of the pandemic and yet do not have access to phones and telemedicine visits. Therefore, a donation of used smartphones, iPads, or other tablets would be immensely helpful to keep those in need safe while still connected to care and their loved ones.</p>

    <h1>our story </h1>

    <p id = "story">It all started when my mother, a physician in the Greater Boston area, received an email from a coworker asking if we had any old but functioning tech at home.</p>

    <button type = "button" onclick='document.getElementById("story").innerHTML = "In early March 2020, my pediatrician mother explained how patients suffering from COVID-19 in hospitals are completely isolated from their families and loved ones because they are often without their personal devices. Many on their deathbed are unable to spend their last few days with the people they love. I thought of my grandparents living in Mumbai, India – if I were unable to FaceTime them every night, I would be devastated. Understanding that this growing tragedy faced many, I created Connect Against COVID to  bring people together via technology. During these scary times of quarantine and isolation, it is important to keep people connected. Together, we can spread love, not the virus."'>read more</button>

It’s so scary on these wards that are sealed off, doors remain closed, little human interaction, and when there is brief human interaction, we are covered by multiple masks, face shields, eye wear, gowns. My introduction starts off with ‘Hi, I’m Cassandra, one of the Urology PAs on call, I’m sorry I can’t shake your hand, and I’m sorry my whole face is completely covered…’ It makes me so sad seeing patients in the ER and floors. These devices will make a difference.”"'>read more</button>

My husband has told me many times about the sadness he and other nurses and doctors go through when a patient cries out for family, and then passes away without being able to see them. It breaks the nurses’ hearts to know how much a family wants to see their loved one, only to be told a short time later that the loved one is gone. They never had one last chance to tell their loved one goodbye. That is why this program idea is so wonderful.”"'>read more</button>
